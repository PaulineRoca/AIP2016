name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + name + "!")
```

(@) Can you guess what the following program does?

```python
sum = 0
for i in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10):
	sum = sum + i
print(sum)
```

(@) What does the following program do?

```python
n = 50
guess = input('Your guess?')

while guess != n:
	if guess > n:
		print('Too large!')
	if guess < n:
		print('Too Small!')
	guess = input('New guess?')

print("Correct!")
```

#ifdef 0

(@) write a program that prints the squares of the first 100 integers 

(@) Given a variable n, compute the sum of the first n integers.

(@) Write a program that computes the sum of all the multiples of 7 below 1000.

(@) Write a function that returns the product of all integers between 1 and n (it is called the factorial of n).

(@) Write a program that returns the 'nth' [Fibonacci number](Fibonacci numbers) F(0) = 0; F(1)=1; F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) 

(@) Compute the estimate of pi using the first 1000 terms of [Wallis formula](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wallis_product). 

(@) Estimate pi using Monte Carlo simulations (taking random points in the (0,1)x(0,1) square and checking if they are in the unit circle (use the function `random.uniform`)

(@) Given a list, return the list that has the same elements in reversed order

(@) Given a list, return its unique elements (remove repeations) 

(@) Compute the frequency of occurences of words in a text file.

(@) Display all anagrams (permutations of letters) of a given word.

(@) Simulate sampling from a urn containing a given proportion of white balls. Display the histogram of the proportions in samples.

(@) Read a file containing two columns, the first containing labels and the second numbers. Compute the means associated to each label.

(@) Draw a cloud of dots at random locations on the screen (suppose you have a function dot((x,y), color)) to display a dot of color color at location (x,y) on the screen; no initialisation code)

(@) Draw a disk that moves and bounces on the screen's border.
