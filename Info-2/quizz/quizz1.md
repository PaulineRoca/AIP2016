Info1 is for complete beginners with no experience of coding at all.

Info2 is for students who already have very basic or intermediate knowledge of coding (professional programmers need not apply). 

It you answer 'yes' to most of the following questions, you can attend info2. 

(@) Do you have basic computer skills? (i.e. do you understand the tree structure of folders? Can you install a software on your computer?)

(@) Do you remember having seen the notion of algorithm in maths courses in high-school (for example to compute the Greatest Common Denominator of two numbers)?

(@) Have you ever entered programs in pocket calculators, on on a computer?

(@) Do you know what is a 'for' loop in a program?

(@) Can you guess what the following Python programs do?

```python
if 2 + 2 == 5: 
	print("Sorry!")
else:
	print("Bonjour!")
```

(@) Can you guess what the following program does?

```python
name = input("What is your name? ")
print("Hello " + name + "!")
```

(@) Can you guess what the following program does?

```python
sum = 0
for i in (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10):
	sum = sum + i
print(sum)
```

(@) What does the following program do?

```python
n = 50
guess = input('Your guess?')

while guess != n:
	if guess > n:
		print('Too large!')
	if guess < n:
		print('Too Small!')
	guess = input('New guess?')

print("Correct!")
```


(@) What does the following program do?

```python
def prod(x):
	p = 1
	for e in x:
		p = p * e
	return p
	
prod([4, 5, 6])
```
