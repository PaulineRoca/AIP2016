Python Programming challenges
=============================

1. Write a python script that finds the 5 largest files inside a directory (searching recursively in subdirs)

2. Write a python script that computes the frequency of occurence of words in a text file (bonus point: plot [Zipf's curve](https://plus.maths.org/content/mystery-zipf))

3. Solve the connectivity problem (see [figure](pb-de-connexit√©.jpg))

4. Implement a simulator of a Turing machine (see Roger Penrose's [chapter's on Turing machines](../books/Penrose_Turing-machines.pdf))
